## Business Processes Nature Assesment Framework

The Business Process Nature Assessment Framework (BPNAF)  enables the quick and efficient assessment of the nature of business processes in an organization in terms of their unpredictability and knowledge intensity. The presentation of the results enables the objective recommendation of the selection of implementation methodologies, HRM policies, or IT systems supporting BPM in line with the real nature of business processes implemented in the organization, in a way that is understandable to both experts and non-experts.
 
This framework contains: 
1. questionnaire generator for dedicated company and evaluating person,
2. system for completing the questionnaire with option of previewing all questionnaires for one entity 
3. questionnaire management including creation of the report. 
Generated report contains process map and results matrix (BPNAM) in a form of two charts and recommendations. As a starting point you can go through several examples available below.
